# Networking 101
## OSI vs TCP/IP levels

### Layers
* Physical 
* Data-Link (Ethernet, wireless)
* Network (IPv4, IPv6, DHCP)
* Transport (TCP, UDP)
* Application (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, TELNET, SMTP, DNS, SSH)

Reasons to have layers:
* Abstraction
* Isolation Functionality
* Clarity =  Realibility

Reasons NOT to have layers:
* Efficiency
