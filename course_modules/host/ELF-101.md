# ELF 101

# Summary

Create an EDURange exercise that is a guided tour of the ELF format for several example binaries. 
Leave a trail of breadcrumbs in various ELF sections that are hints and clues to moving to the next
step. For example, have a notes section that has the next `readelf` command to execute.
